## Usage

- Copy and rename `config_temp.toml` to `config.toml` in the path where the program will be executed in.
- Fill all fields in the config file. The `font` field should be the font family name (ex. `Source Han Sans`).
- Run `cargo run --release` to run the app directly or `cargo build --release` to dump built binaries.
